## Anonymize Submissions

For the anonymous voting title, abstract and content where extracted and
parts that could identify the author were removed. However, we took care in no
way to change the content or meaning of the submission. Thankfully this process
was limited to removal of links (previous talks, talk content, etc.). With a
few submission we had to expose the author as it was impossible to anonymize
without changing the content. Think of "I am author of X and this is the topic
of my talk".

## Voting

We came to the conclusion that a simple spreadsheet per reviewer is a
straightforward way to collect votes. The spreadsheet contained the following
columns: rating, level, and actuality. The rating was a simple 1-10 scale.

Submissions for the event were awesome and I can share that all of them
received very good ratings. Some of our reviewers shared some extra comments
that were nice to follow and helped us to understand their point of view.

## Selection Process

The core group of selection process was a team of three people, where two did
not participate in the voting process. We studied all submissions in detail.
Our intention was to split do selection in three groups: 1) talks strictly by
the rating, 2) talks by diversity, and 3) talks by regionality.

Note that the form for CFP submissions did not ask for any personal information
but had a yes/no question if the author belongs to an underrepresented group.
Any submission that answered this question with yes was automatically included
in the diversity group.

As EuRuKo literally has Europe in its name, we wanted to make sure that we have
a strong representation of talks from all over Europe. Unfortunately we did not
enforce to share the location of author and it was quite tedious to find out
where the author is currently living at.

Interestingly, we found out that ordering the talks by rating already resulted
in a mix that almost represented the diversity and regionality we were looking
for and we only had to make minor adjustments.
