# EuRuKo 2024, A Retrospective

Some notes and comments on the speakers & programme organization of EuRuKo
2024.

# CFP Organization Flow

- Setup External Tool for CFP Submissions
- Collect Submissions after Deadline (Export)
- Go Through Submissions and Anonymize Content
- Generate PDF Documents for all Reviewers
- Process Rating by a Jury of 17 Independent Reviewers
- Collect Votes and Calculate Results
- Run the Selection Process with Sorted Ratings (Categories: Top, Diversity,
  Regionality)

## Anonymize Submissions

For the anonymous voting, the titles, abstracts and main bodies where extracted
from all submissions. Parts that could identify the author were removed.
However, we took care to not change the content or meaning of the submission.
Thankfully this process was limited to removal of links (previous talks, talk
content, etc.). With a few submission we had to expose the author as it was
impossible to anonymize without changing the content. Think of "I am author of
X and this is the topic of my talk".

## Voting

We came to the conclusion that a simple spreadsheet per reviewer is a
straightforward way to collect votes. The spreadsheet contained the following
columns: rating, audience expert level, and actuality. The rating scales ranged
from 1 to 10.

Submissions for the event were awesome and I can share that all of them
received very good ratings. Some of our reviewers added some extra comments
that were nice to follow and helped us to understand their point of view.

## Selection Process

The core group of selection process was a team of three people, where two did
not participate in the voting process. We studied all submissions in detail.
Our intention was to split do selection in three groups: 1) talks strictly by
the rating, 2) talks by diversity, and 3) talks by regionality.

Note that the form for CFP submissions did not ask for any personal information
but had a yes/no question if the author belongs to an underrepresented group.
Any submission that answered this question with yes was automatically included
in the diversity group.

As EuRuKo literally has Europe in its name, we wanted to make sure that we have
a strong representation of talks from all over Europe. Unfortunately we did not
enforce to share the location of author and it was quite tedious to find out
where the author is currently living at.

Interestingly, we found out that ordering the talks by rating already resulted
in a mix that almost represented the diversity and regionality we were looking
for and we only had to make minor adjustments.

## Notes, Hints, and Comments

- Have location/country of the author in the submission form as required field.
- Reach out to organisations that support underrepresented groups to get more
  submissions. Contact [WNB.rb](https://www.wnb-rb.dev/) for Ruby devs, or
  [Speakerinnen.org](https://www.speakerinnen.org/en) that will be happy to
  support.
- Have many many adapters available, it is not enough to have some of kinds as
  those will disappear and appear during the event.
- Ensure there's always water at the stage for speakers.
- Create a guide for the MC of the event. Notes for the opening and closing
  speeches are most important. Share all the details you found out about
  speakers during CFP or invite process.
- Double check ratio of presentation device (screens, projectors) and
  communicate this to speakers. Further, device refresh rate can cause issues,
  verify that the device is compatible with the presentation device. This is
  especially true for any backup device you provide.
