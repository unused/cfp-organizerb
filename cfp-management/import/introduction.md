Dear REVIEWER!

Please find all Call for Presentation (CFP) submissions for EuRuKo 2024, handed
in via papercall.io, with this document. Read them carefully and follow the
voting guidelines to place your valued rating.

The CFP selection is a multi-stage process. The anonymous review is the first,
most heavily weighted step. It is content focused and results in a list of
candidates for speaker selection ranked by your rating. In the following stage
another small team reviews the list and elects entries for the program, with an
emphasis on creating a diverse panel of speakers, as well as covering a broad
range of topics.

Please reach out to \#cfp-committee channel at Discord or contact Christoph,
Damir, or Muhamed if you have any question or concern.

## Disclaimer

This review is generated for REVIEWER. As submissions are not meant to be
shared, we expect you to ensure document safety and remove all copies after the
rating process.

## Rating Result Sheet

Use the _[rating spreadsheet](SUBMISSIONURL)_\footnote{SUBMISSIONSAFEURL}
and enter your ratings. We will collect the result after May 15, 2024. Any
rating added after this date cannot be considered.
